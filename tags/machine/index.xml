      <title>Activation functions: Softmax and Sigmoid Compared</title>

      <description>What are activation functions ? Activation functions are the key to Neural Networks (NN). They are the recipe to learn non-linear relationships in data, without them NNs would just be linear in nature. If you know the basics of logistic regression, you&amp;rsquo;ll understand the statement I made. I am planning to write another blog to cover activation functions from basics, therefore the focus here is just to compare softmax and sigmoid activation functions.</description>

      <description>We need to learn about bias and variance in order to understand how to fix underfitting and overfitting of model. Spend enough time to read and understand, everything till the end of the blog, where you get to know how to apply the concepts (helpful for MLS-C01 exam too!)
What are Bias and Variance ? Welcome to the world of bias and variance. It may be confusing at first, but by end of the blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll have full clarity.</description>

      <description>What are hyperparameters ? In simple terms, hyperparameters are a set of knobs you can tune before starting the learning process in machine learning. When set to a specific values, the model has a specific performance. When the hyperparameters are set to new values, the model gets new performance values.
What is performance of a model? In any machine learning process, we want to optimize the objective-function: a fancy name for a function that evaluates model predictions v/s values provided during training.</description>

What is segmentation of image in machine learning? In the field of computer vision in machine learning, an image can be broken into segments by learning a mask for each segment. Image segmentation is used to locate object boundaries (lines, curves etc.) and assign a label to each pixel.
For example, this is from opencv documentation (watershed algorithm) where boundaries of a set of coins are learnt:
Original Image Semantic Segmentation Mask Learnt from Original Image  Sudo Exam Tip: Remember to recall image segmentation as a technique when there is a mention of classification of objects in an image at pixel level.</description>
