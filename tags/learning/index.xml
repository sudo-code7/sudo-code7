      <description>What are hyperparameters ? In simple terms, hyperparameters are a set of knobs you can tune before starting the learning process in machine learning. When set to a specific values, the model has a specific performance. When the hyperparameters are set to new values, the model gets new performance values.
What is performance of a model? In any machine learning process, we want to optimize the objective-function: a fancy name for a function that evaluates model predictions v/s values provided during training.</description>

What is segmentation of image in machine learning? In the field of computer vision in machine learning, an image can be broken into segments by learning a mask for each segment. Image segmentation is used to locate object boundaries (lines, curves etc.) and assign a label to each pixel.
For example, this is from opencv documentation (watershed algorithm) where boundaries of a set of coins are learnt:
