      <description>What is segmentation of image in machine learning? In the field of computer vision in machine learning, an image can be broken into segments by learning a mask for each segment. Image segmentation is used to locate object boundaries (lines, curves etc.) and assign a label to each pixel.
For example, this is from opencv documentation (watershed algorithm) where boundaries of a set of coins are learnt:
{{  }} Exam Tip: Remember to recall image segmentation as a technique when there is a mention of classification of objects in an image at pixel level.</description>
